In Java we have primitive and reference types
Primitive - 8
char
boolean
byte
short
int
long
float
double
**look up bit size**
Reference - an object; more than just a value

Java is a passes by value language
It passes the values of references rather than the references
	themselves.
Numeric type conversions 
	Look out for loss of precision
	Narrowing
	Widening
