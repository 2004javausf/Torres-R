Inheritance
	when a programming language allows for a hierarchy of objects
	chlid objects obtain states and behaviors from parent objects
	multiple inheritance is not supported in Java (but interfaces)
	**Diamond problem**
Encapsulation
	wrap and protect data fields, preventing manipulation outside of
		the class
	Usually requires getter and setter methods to change these values
	Conceal internal state of object. Preserving integrity
Polymorphism
	the ability for the programming language to be able to tell the
		difference between objects and methods of the same name with
		different variable/class types.
	Overriding - same name, same parameters, different behavior.
	Overloading - same name, different parameters, different behavior
	Yes, many forms but...
	Multiple "is-a" relationships
	Covariance
Abstraction
	Sometimes omitted from pillars of OOP
	Hiding the implementation details
	"what it does, not how it does it"
	Exposing only functionality
	Abstract Class - abstract methods have no implementation
